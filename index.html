        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few things I'm interested in. Probably one of the most interesting things I have, well, Interests in is entertainment trivia. 
            What I mean by that is learning all about how movies, video games, almost any sort of media is made. 
            That's one of the biggest reasons why I usually research on how movies or games are made.
        </p>
        <p>
            While on the subject of digital media, I have recently become quite an enthusiast for almost anything Virtual Reality related. 
            When I got my first headset, the Oculus Quest 2, I was blown away by how amazing it worked and learning how it does work inspired me to go deep into the industry.
            While I have not developped VR apps or made any kind of VR hardware, it is something that I am fondly interested in.
            I have even come up with multiple ideas for VR games, including ones focused around subjects of education mixed with gaming mechanics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The final thing I'll mention is haunted houses. 
            Despite it scaring me and many others as its main purpose, I love it for the thrill of running away from monsters. 
            Although I love it more when there are creative designs used to create the rooms. 
            Make-up on the actors - er, monsters, are especially awesome to see.
